## 🔧 Content Management Pipeline (By Homer Adriel Dorin)

This project includes a unified pipeline for extracting exam questions from PDFs and converting them into web-ready JSON format.

### Quick Start for New Years

```bash
# Extract questions from PDFs (auto-creates directories)
cd scripts
python pipeline.py parse-questions --year 2025

# Place questions.pdf and answers.pdf in data/2025/
# Manually crop diagrams following console instructions
# Add visual content to questions
python pipeline.py add-visuals --year 2025
```

### Pipeline Features

- **Auto-directory Creation**: Creates year-specific folder structure automatically
- **PDF Processing**: Extracts questions/answers and renders pages for manual cropping
- **Visual Content Integration**: Supports 3 types of visual content (diagrams, choices, composites)
- **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive logging with `--verbose` flag
- **Safe Testing**: `--dry-run` mode for validation without file changes

For detailed pipeline documentation, see PIPELINE_USAGE.md under scripts/ for more details!
