    question: `![Image](Files/2025/question_diagrams/2025-1.png)

As shown in Figure 1, there is a box that generates a single output for two (2) inputs. The 
input in this box is either “Agree” or “Disagree,” and the output of “Agree” is generated only 
when both inputs are “Agree,” while in other cases the output of “Disagree” is generated. 
When three (3) inputs are entered into two (2) boxes as shown in Figure 2, which of the 
following is the correct description concerning the output?`,
    options: [
      "The output of “Agree” is generated at all times when one (1) or more inputs are “Agree.”",
      "The output of “Agree” is generated at all times when two (2) or more inputs are “Agree.”",
      "The output of “Disagree” is generated only when two (2) or more inputs are “Disagree.”",
      "The output of “Agree” is generated only when all three (3) inputs are “Agree.”",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    solution: `
    ## Problem Framing
    We are looking at a system of cascaded logic boxes. The goal is to determine the condition required to get a final output of "Agree".
    
    ### Guided Construction: Identifying the "Gate"
    The key is in the definition of the box:"...the output of 'Agree' is generated only when both inputs are 'Agree'..."
    
    In Computer Science terms, this is the definition of an AND Gate. If we let "Agree" = 1 (True) and "Disagree" = 0 (False), the box performs the operation:
    
    Output = Input_1 \cdot Input_2
    
    A single "Disagree" (False) anywhere in the chain messes up the whole thing and forces the final output to be "Disagree".

  Therefore, the final output is "Agree" if and only if all three inputs are "Agree" (d.).

The automation of the inspections performed by a quality controller is considered. By 
providing as training data 10,000 product images and the results of judgments by the quality 
controller about whether each product is defective or not, a machine learning model is created 
to judge whether a product is defective or not. The results of a test judgement by a machine 
learning model on 100 product images are as shown in the table. When the ratio of the number 
of images that product is judged to be defective by the machine learning model out of the 
images that product is judged to be defective by the quality controller is deemed to be the 
recall rate, what is the recall rate in this test judgement? [See Diagram Above]`,

    question: `A system development project has more defects than the quality targets. In order to clarify 
the issues to prioritize for resolution, the number of defects for each cause is to be 
investigated and shown with a chart. Which of the following is an appropriate chart to use?`,
    options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    solution: `
The question asks for a chart that does two specific things:

  Shows the number of defects for each cause.
  
  Helps prioritize which issues to resolve first.

Essentially, we need a tool that identifies the "vital few" from the "trivial many."

### Guided Construction: Analyzing the Options
These are the "Seven Basic Tools of Quality." Let's see what each pattern represents:

Option (a): This looks like a skeleton. It maps relationships between an effect and its multiple potential causes.
  
Question: Does this show "numbers/counts" or just "relationships"?

Option (b): A bar chart sorted in descending order, overlaid with a cumulative percentage line.

Question: If you wanted to see which 20% of causes are creating 80% of your problems (prioritization), which chart is designed exactly for that?

Option (c): A collection of data points on an X-Y axis.

Question: Is this used for counting categories, or for seeing if two variables (like "study time" and "test scores") move together?

Option (d): Rectangles and diamonds with arrows.

Question: Does this show statistics, or does it show a step-by-step process flow?

##Correct Answer
The correct answer is (b).

### Why (b) is the winner: The Pareto Chart
The chart in image (b) is a Pareto Chart.

The Bars: Represent the frequency (number of defects) for each cause, sorted from most frequent to least frequent.

The Line: Represents the cumulative total

The Goal: It follows the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle). By looking at the highest bars on the left, you immediately know which "causes" to prioritize to get the biggest improvement in quality.

### Why the others are eliminated:
(a) Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram: Great for brainstorming what the causes are, but it doesn't quantify them or show which one happens most often.

(c) Scatter Diagram: Used to find correlations between two variables.

(d) Flowchart: Used to visualize a process or algorithm, not to analyze defect data.
